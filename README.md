# liri-node-app

This is a command line app which allows users to look up information about songs, concerts, or movies depending on what command they type into the command line. 

The app uses three different apis (OMDB for movies, Spotify for songs, and Band In Town for concerts) to deal with user requests. The program parses user input to determine which API to scan and which term to request, then logs relevant data to the command line. Users can also type in a fourth command, in which the program will read a file of random text, then operate a command based on that text.

Here are a few gifs of the program in action:
